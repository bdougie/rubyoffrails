Recipe Hash
====================================================

Most programs have data -- here we talk about 3 ways to store data in a program:
the ever-present Hash, the cool-kid Struct, and a regular Class.

Your Assignment
---------------

It should have
  * a current city, a number of engines, a number of cars, and a caboose.
  * output the train formatted nicely.
  * Create a passenger Struct that has a name and a train (from above)
